## Thoughts

Firstly, I hope that I understood all tasks correctly and completed them according to the specified requirements :)

Secondly, is it ok if I used Prisma in this project? Hope this is not a big deal, if it is - I ready to redo the task

Thirdly, in requirements you've sayed that state manager should be Redux. I implemented it, but have one quesiton: is it truly necessary? If data fetching occurs within a single component - in this component you use it, you don't bother about sharing it with other components. I think that it is overhead to use Redux in this small test task. Nevertheless, it is the best way to see how candidate can deal with it :)

## Stack

Frontend: ReactTS (Vite), Redux, react-router-dom, tailwind 

Backend: Nest JS (TypeScript), PrismaORM (just easier to write queries), MySQL,
